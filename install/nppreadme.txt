This program will install the FHIR Notepad++ plug-in - 32 or 64bit

* Notepad++ Help About will say whether you you have 32 or 64 bit
* Choose the location of the installed version of Notepad++
  (installer guesses the default location, but this is often wrong)

If Notepad++ is running during the install, you'll need to restart 
it after the install is complete
