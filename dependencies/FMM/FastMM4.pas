Version 1.0.7

This is a fork of the "Fast Memory Manager" (FastMM) v4.993 by Pierre le Riche
(see below for the original FastMM4 description)

What was added to FastMM4-AVX in comparison to the original FastMM4:

 - Efficient synchronization
   - improved synchronization between the threads; proper synchronization
     techniques are used depending on context and availability, i.e., spin-wait
     loops, umonitor / umwait, SwitchToThread, critical sections, etc.;
   - used the "test, test-and-set" technique for the spin-wait loops; this
     technique is recommended by Intel (see Section 11.4.3 "Optimization with
     Spin-Locks" of the Intel 64 and IA-32 Architectures Optimization Reference
     Manual) to determine the availability of the synchronization variable;
     according to this technique, the first "test" is done via the normal
     (non-locking) memory load to prevent excessive bus locking on each
     iteration of the spin-wait loop; if the variable is available upon
     the normal memory load of the first step ("test"), proceed to the
     second step ("test-and-set") which is done via the bus-locking atomic
     "xchg" instruction; however, this two-steps approach of using "test" before
     "test-and-set" can increase the cost for the un-contended case comparing
     to just single-step "test-and-set", this may explain why the speed benefits
     of the FastMM4-AVX are more pronounced when the memory manager is called
     from multiple threads in parallel, while in single-threaded use scenario
     there may be no benefit compared to the original FastMM4;
   - the number of iterations of "pause"-based spin-wait loops is 5000,
     before relinquishing to SwitchToThread();
   - see https://stackoverflow.com/a/44916975 for more details on the
     implementation of the "pause"-based spin-wait loops;
   - using normal memory store to release a lock:
     FastMM4-AVX uses normal memory store, i.e., the "mov" instruction, rather
     then the bus-locking "xchg" instruction to write into the synchronization
     variable (LockByte) to "release a lock" on a data structure,
     see https://stackoverflow.com/a/44959764
     for discussion on releasing a lock;
     you man define "InterlockedRelease" to get the old behavior of the original
     FastMM4.
   - implemented dedicated lock and unlock procedures that operate with
     synchronization variables (LockByte);
     before that, locking operations were scattered throughout the code;
     now the locking functions have meaningful names:
     AcquireLockByte and ReleaseLockByte;
     the values of the lock byte are now checked for validity when
     FullDebugMode or DEBUG is defined, to detect cases when the same lock is
     released twice, and other improper use of the lock bytes;
   - added compile-time options "SmallBlocksLockedCriticalSection",
     "MediumBlocksLockedCriticalSection" and "LargeBlocksLockedCriticalSection"
     which are set by default (inside the FastMM4Options.inc file) as
     conditional defines. If you undefine these options, you will get the
     old locking mechanism of the original FastMM4 based on loops of Sleep() or
     SwitchToThread().

 - AVX, AVX2 or AVX512 instructions for faster memory copy
   - if the CPU supports AVX or AVX2, use the 32-byte YMM registers
     for faster memory copy, and if the CPU supports AVX-512,
     use the 64-byte ZMM registers for even faster memory copy;
   - please note that the effect of using AVX instruction in speed improvement is
     negligible, compared to the effect brought by efficient synchronization;
     sometimes AVX instructions can even slow down the program because of AVX-SSE
     transition penalties and reduced CPU frequency caused by AVX-512
     instructions in some processors; use DisableAVX to turn AVX off completely
     or use DisableAVX1/DisableAVX2/DisableAVX512 to disable separately certain
     AVX-related instruction set from being compiled);
   - if EnableAVX is defined, all memory blocks are aligned by 32 bytes, but
     you can also use Align32Bytes define without AVX; please note that the memory
     overhead is higher when the blocks are aligned by 32 bytes, because some
     memory is lost by padding; however, if your CPU supports
     "Fast Short REP MOVSB" (Ice Lake or newer), you can disable AVX, and align
     by just 8 bytes, and this may even be faster because less memory is wasted
     on alignment;
   - with AVX, memory copy is secure - all XMM/YMM/ZMM registers used to copy
     memory are cleared by vxorps/vpxor, so the leftovers of the copied memory
     are not exposed in the XMM/YMM/ZMM registers;
   - the code attempts to properly handle AVX-SSE transitions to not incur the
     transition penalties, only call vzeroupper under AVX1, but not under AVX2
     since it slows down subsequent SSE code under Skylake / Kaby Lake;
   - on AVX-512, writing to xmm16-xmm31 registers will not affect the turbo
     clocks, and will not impose AVX-SSE transition penalties; therefore, when we
     have AVX-512, we now only use x(y/z)mm16-31 registers.

 - Speed improvements due to code optimization and proper techniques
   - if the CPU supports Enhanced REP MOVSB/STOSB (ERMS), use this feature
     for faster memory copy (under 32 bit or 64-bit) (see the EnableERMS define,
     on by default, use DisableERMS to turn it off);
   - if the CPU supports Fast Short REP MOVSB (FSRM), uses this feature instead
     of AVX;
   - branch target alignment in assembly routines is only used when
     EnableAsmCodeAlign is defined; Delphi incorrectly encodes conditional
     jumps, i.e., use long, 6-byte instructions instead of just short, 2-byte,
     and this may affect branch prediction, so the benefits of branch target
     alignment may not outweigh the disadvantage of affected branch prediction,
     see https://stackoverflow.com/q/45112065
   - compare instructions + conditional jump instructions are put together
     to allow macro-op fusion (which happens since Core2 processors, when
     the first instruction is a CMP or TEST instruction and the second
     instruction is a conditional jump instruction);
   - multiplication and division by a constant, which is a power of 2
     replaced to shl/shr, because Delphi64 compiler doesn't replace such
     multiplications and divisions to shl/shr processor instructions,
     and, according to the Intel Optimization Reference Manual, shl/shr is
     faster than imul/idiv, at least for some processors.

 - Safer, cleaner code with stricter type adherence and better compatibility
   - names assigned to some constants that used to be "magic constants",
     i.e., unnamed numerical constants - plenty of them were present
     throughout the whole code;
   - removed some typecasts; the code is stricter to let the compiler
     do the job, check everything and mitigate probable error. You can
     even compile the code with "integer overflow checking" and
     "range checking", as well as with "typed @ operator" - for safer
     code. Also added round bracket in the places where the typed @ operator
     was used, to better emphasize on who's address is taken;
   - the compiler environment is more flexible now: you can now compile FastMM4
     with, for example, typed "@" operator or any other option. Almost all
     externally-set compiler directives are honored by FastMM except a few
     (currently just one) - look for the "Compiler options for FastMM4" section
     below to see what options cannot be externally set and are always
     redefined by FastMM4 for itself - even if you set up these compiler options
     differently outside FastMM4, they will be silently
     redefined, and the new values will be used for FastMM4 only;
   - the type of one-byte synchronization variables (accessed via "lock cmpxchg"
     or "lock xchg") replaced from Boolean to Byte for stricter type checking;
   - those fixed-block-size memory move procedures that are not needed
     (under the current bitness and alignment combinations) are
     explicitly excluded from compiling, to not rely on the compiler
     that is supposed to remove these function after compilation;
   - added length parameter to what were the dangerous null-terminated string
     operations via PAnsiChar, to prevent potential stack buffer overruns
     (or maybe even stack-based exploitation?), and there some Pascal functions
     also left, the argument is not yet checked. See the "todo" comments
     to figure out where the length is not yet checked. Anyway, since these
     memory functions are only used in Debug mode, i.e., in development
     environment, not in Release (production), the impact of this
     "vulnerability" is minimal (albeit this is a questionable statement);
   - removed all non-US-ASCII characters, to avoid using UTF-8 BOM, for
     better compatibility with very early versions of Delphi (e.g., Delphi 5),
     thanks to Valts Silaputnins;
   - support for Lazarus 1.6.4 with FreePascal (the original FastMM4 4.992
     requires modifications, it doesn't work under Lazarus 1.6.4 with FreePascal
     out-of-the-box, also tested under Lazarus 1.8.2 / FPC 3.0.4 with Win32
     target; later versions should be also supported.

Here are the comparison of the Original FastMM4 version 4.992, with default
options compiled for Win64 by Delphi 10.2 Tokyo (Release with Optimization),
and the current FastMM4-AVX branch ("AVX-br."). Under some multi-threading
scenarios, the FastMM4-AVX branch is more than twice as fast compared to the
Original FastMM4. The tests have been run on two different computers: one
under Xeon E5-2543v2 with 2 CPU sockets, each has 6 physical cores
(12 logical threads) - with only 5 physical core per socket enabled for the
test application. Another test was done under an i7-7700K CPU.

Used the "Multi-threaded allocate, use and free" and "NexusDB"
test cases from the FastCode Challenge Memory Manager test suite,
modified to run under 64-bit.

FastMM4-AVX Version History:

- 1.0.7 (21 March 2023) - implemented the use of umonitor/umwait instructions;
    thanks to TetzkatLipHoka for the updated FullDebugMode to v1.64
    of the original FastMM4.

- 1.0.6 (25 August 2021) - it can now be compiled with any alignment (8, 16, 32)
    regardless of the target (x86, x64) and whether inline assembly is used
    or not; the "PurePascal" conditional define to disable inline assembly at
    all, however, in this case, efficient locking would not work since it
    uses inline assembly; FreePascal now uses the original FreePascal compiler
    mode, rather than the Delphi compatibility mode as before; resolved many
    FreePascal compiler warnings; supported branch target alignment
    in FreePascal inline assembly; small block types now always have
    block sizes of 1024 and 2048 bytes, while in previous versions
    instead of 1024-byte blocks there were 1056-byte blocks,
    and instead of 2048-byte blocks were 2176-byte blocks;
    fixed Delphi compiler hints for 64-bit Release mode; Win32 and Win64 
    versions compiled under Delphi and FreePascal passed the all the FastCode 
    validation suites.

- 1.05 (20 May 2021) - improved speed of releasing memory blocks on higher thread
    contention. It is also possible to compile FastMM4-AVX without a single
    inline assembly code. Renamed some conditional defines to be self-explaining.
    Rewritten some comments to be meaningful. Made it compile under FreePascal
    for Linux 64-bit and 32-bit. Also made it compile under FreePascal for
    Windows 32-bit and 64-bit. Memory move functions for 152, 184 and 216 bytes
    were incorrect Linux. Move216AVX1 and Move216AVX2 Linux implementation had
    invalid opcodes. Added support for the GetFPCHeapStatus(). Optimizations on
    single-threaded performance. If you define DisablePauseAndSwitchToThread,
    it will use EnterCriticalSection/LeaveCriticalSectin. An attempt to free a
    memory block twice was not caught under 32-bit Delphi. Added SSE fixed block
    copy routines for 32-bit targets. Added support for the "Fast Short REP MOVSB"
    CPU feature. Removed redundant SSE code from 64-bit targets.
- 1.04 (O6 October 2020) - improved use of AVX-512 instructions to avoid turbo
    clock reduction and SSE/AVX transition penalty; made explicit order of
    parameters for GetCPUID to avoid calling convention ambiguity that could
    lead to incorrect use of registers and finally crashes, i.e., under Linux;
    improved explanations and comments, i.e., about the use of the
    synchronization techniques.
- 1.03 (04 May 2018) - minor fixes for the debug mode, FPC compatibility
    and code readability cosmetic fixes.
- 1.02 (07 November 2017) - added and tested support for the AVX-512
    instruction set.
- 1.01 (10 October 2017) - made the source code compile under Delphi5,
    thanks to Valts Silaputnins.
- 1.00 (27 July 2017) - initial revision.


The original FastMM4 description follows:

Fast Memory Manager 4.993

Description:
 A fast replacement memory manager for Embarcadero Delphi Win32 applications
 that scales well under multi-threaded usage, is not prone to memory
 fragmentation, and supports shared memory without the use of external .DLL
 files.

Homepage:
 Version 4: https://github.com/pleriche/FastMM4
 Version 5: https://github.com/pleriche/FastMM5

Advantages:
 - Fast
 - Low overhead. FastMM is designed for an average of 5% and maximum of 10%
   overhead per block.
 - Supports up to 3GB of user mode address space under Windows 32-bit and 4GB
   under Windows 64-bit. Add the "$SetPEFlags $20" option (in curly braces)
   to your .dpr to enable this.
 - Highly aligned memory blocks. Can be configured for either 8-byte, 16-byte
   or 32-byte alignment.
 - Good scaling under multi-threaded applications
 - Intelligent reallocations. Avoids slow memory move operations through
   not performing unnecessary downsizes and by having a minimum percentage
   block size growth factor when an in-place block upsize is not possible.
 - Resistant to address space fragmentation
 - No external DLL required when sharing memory between the application and
   external libraries (provided both use this memory manager)
 - Optionally reports memory leaks on program shutdown. (This check can be set
   to be performed only if Delphi is currently running on the machine, so end
   users won't be bothered by the error message.)
 - Supports Delphi 4 (or later), C++ Builder 4 (or later), Kylix 3.

Usage:
 Delphi:
  Place this unit as the very first unit under the "uses" section in your
  project's .dpr file. When sharing memory between an application and a DLL
  (e.g. when passing a long string or dynamic array to a DLL function), both the
  main application and the DLL must be compiled using this memory manager (with
  the required conditional defines set). There are some conditional defines
  (inside FastMM4Options.inc) that may be used to tweak the memory manager. To
  enable support for a user mode address space greater than 2GB you will have to
  use the EditBin* tool to set the LARGE_ADDRESS_AWARE flag in the EXE header.
  This informs Windows x64 or Windows 32-bit (with the /3GB option set) that the
  application supports an address space larger than 2GB (up to 4GB). In Delphi 6
  and later you can also specify this flag through the compiler directive
  {$SetPEFlags $20}

Change log:
 Version 1.00 (28 June 2004):
  - First version (called PSDMemoryManager). Based on RecyclerMM (free block
    stack approach) by Eric Grange.
 Version 2.00 (3 November 2004):
  - Complete redesign and rewrite from scratch. Name changed to FastMM to
    reflect this fact. Uses a linked-list approach. Is faster, has less memory
    overhead, and will now catch most bad pointers on FreeMem calls.
 Version 3.00 (1 March 2005):
  - Another rewrite. Reduced the memory overhead by: (a) not having a separate
    memory area for the linked list of free blocks (uses space inside free
    blocks themselves) (b) batch managers are allocated as part of chunks (c)
    block size lookup table size reduced. This should make FastMM more CPU
    cache friendly.
 Version 4.00 (7 June 2005):
  - Yet another rewrite. FastMM4 is in fact three memory managers in one: Small
    blocks (up to a few KB) are managed through the binning model in the same
    way as previous versions, medium blocks (from a few KB up to approximately
    256K) are allocated in a linked-list fashion, and large blocks are grabbed
    directly from the system through VirtualAlloc. This 3-layered design allows
    very fast operation with the most frequently used block sizes (small
    blocks), while also minimizing fragmentation and imparting significant
    overhead savings with blocks larger than a few KB.
 Version 4.01 (8 June 2005):
  - Added the options "RequireDebugInfoForLeakReporting" and
    "RequireIDEPresenceForLeakReporting" as suggested by Pierre Y.
  - Fixed the "DelphiIsRunning" function not working under Delphi 5, and
    consequently, no leak checking. (Reported by Anders Isaksson and Greg.)
 Version 4.02 (8 June 2005):
  - Fixed the compilation error when both the "AssumeMultiThreaded" and
    "CheckHeapForCorruption options were set. (Reported by Francois Malan.)
 Version 4.03 (9 June 2005):
  - Added descriptive error messages when FastMM4 cannot be installed because
    another MM has already been installed or memory has already been allocated.
 Version 4.04 (13 June 2005):
  - Added a small fixed offset to the size of medium blocks (previously always
    exact multiples of 256 bytes). This makes performance problems due to CPU
    cache associativity limitations much less likely. (Reported by Craig
    Peterson.)
 Version 4.05 (17 June 2005):
  - Added the Align16Bytes option. Disable this option to drop the 16 byte
    alignment restriction and reduce alignment to 8 bytes for the smallest
    block sizes. Disabling Align16Bytes should lower memory consumption at the
    cost of complicating the use of aligned SSE move instructions. (Suggested
    by Craig Peterson.)
  - Added a support unit for C++ Builder 6 - Add FastMM4BCB.cpp and
    FastMM4.pas to your BCB project to use FastMM instead of the RTL MM. Memory
    leak checking is not supported because (unfortunately) once an MM is
    installed under BCB you cannot uninstall it... at least not without
    modifying the RTL code in exit.c or patching the RTL code runtime. (Thanks
    to Jarek Karciarz, Vladimir Ulchenko and Bob Gonder.)
 Version 4.06 (22 June 2005):
  - Displays the class of all leaked objects on the memory leak report and also
    tries to identify leaked long strings. Previously it only displayed the
    sizes of all leaked blocks. (Suggested by Ben Taylor.)
  - Added support for displaying the sizes of medium and large block memory
    leaks. Previously it only displayed details for small block leaks.
 Version 4.07 (22 June 2005):
  - Fixed the detection of the class of leaked objects not working under
    Windows 98/Me.
 Version 4.08 (27 June 2005):
  - Added a BorlndMM.dpr project to allow you to build a borlndmm.dll that uses
    FastMM4 instead of the default memory manager. You may replace the old
    DLL in the Delphi \Bin directory to make the IDE use this memory manager
    instead.
 Version 4.09 (30 June 2005):
  - Included a patch fix for the bug affecting replacement borlndmm.dll files
    with Delphi 2005 (QC#14007). Compile the patch, close Delphi, and run it
    once to patch your vclide90.bpl. You will now be able to use the
    replacement borlndmm.dll to speed up the Delphi 2005 IDE as well.
 Version 4.10 (7 July 2005):
  - Due to QC#14070 ("Delphi IDE attempts to free memory after the shutdown
    code of borlndmm.dll has been called"), FastMM cannot be uninstalled
    safely when used inside a replacement borlndmm.dll for the IDE. Added a
    conditional define "NeverUninstall" for this purpose.
  - Added the "FullDebugMode" option to pad all blocks with a header and footer
    to help you catch memory overwrite bugs in your applications. All blocks
    returned to freemem are also zeroed out to help catch bugs involving the
    use of previously freed blocks. Also catches attempts at calling virtual
    methods of freed objects provided the block in question has not been reused
    since the object was freed. Displays stack traces on error to aid debugging.
  - Added the "LogErrorsToFile" option to log all errors to a text file in the
    same folder as the application.
  - Added the "ManualLeakReportingControl" option (suggested by Nahan Hyn) to
    enable control over whether the memory leak report should be done or not
    via a global variable.
 Version 4.11 (7 July 2005):
  - Fixed a compilation error under Delphi 2005 due to QC#10922. (Thanks to Joe
    Bain and Leonel Togniolli.)
  - Fixed leaked object classes not displaying in the leak report in
    "FullDebugMode".
  Version 4.12 (8 July 2005):
  - Moved all the string constants to one place to make it easier to do
    translations into other languages. (Thanks to Robert Marquardt.)
  - Added support for Kylix. Some functionality is currently missing: No
    support for detecting the object class on leaks and also no MM sharing.
    (Thanks to Simon Kissel and Fikret Hasovic).
  Version 4.13 (11 July 2005):
  - Added the FastMM_DebugInfo.dll support library to display debug info for
    stack traces.
  - Stack traces for the memory leak report is now logged to the log file in
    "FullDebugMode".
  Version 4.14 (14 July 2005):
  - Fixed string leaks not being detected as such in "FullDebugMode". (Thanks
    to Leonel Togniolli.)
  - Fixed the compilation error in "FullDebugMode" when "LogErrorsToFile" is
    not set. (Thanks to Leonel Togniolli.)
  - Added a "Release" option to allow the grouping of various options and to
    make it easier to make debug and release builds. (Thanks to Alexander
    Tabakov.)
  - Added a "HideMemoryLeakHintMessage" option to not display the hint below
    the memory leak message. (Thanks to Alexander Tabakov.)
  - Changed the fill character for "FullDebugMode" from zero to $80 to be able
    to differentiate between invalid memory accesses using nil pointers to
    invalid memory accesses using fields of freed objects. FastMM tries to
    reserve the 64K block starting at $80800000 at startup to ensure that an
    A/V will occur when this block is accessed. (Thanks to Alexander Tabakov.)
  - Fixed some compiler warnings. (Thanks to M. Skloff)
  - Fixed some display bugs in the memory leak report. (Thanks to Leonel
    Togniolli.)
  - Added a "LogMemoryLeakDetailToFile" option. Some applications leak a lot of
    memory and can make the log file grow very large very quickly.
  - Added the option to use madExcept instead of the JCL Debug library in the
    debug info support DLL. (Thanks to Martin Aignesberger.)
  - Added procedures "GetMemoryManagerState" and "GetMemoryMap" to retrieve
    statistics about the current state of the memory manager and memory pool.
    (A usage tracker form together with a demo is also available.)
  Version 4.15 (14 July 2005):
  - Fixed a false 4GB(!) memory leak reported in some instances.
  Version 4.16 (15 July 2005):
  - Added the "CatchUseOfFreedInterfaces" option to catch the use of interfaces
    of freed objects. This option is not compatible with checking that a freed
    block has not been modified, so enable this option only when hunting an
    invalid interface reference. (Only relevant if "FullDebugMode" is set.)
  - During shutdown FastMM now checks that all free blocks have not been
    modified since being freed. (Only when "FullDebugMode" is set and
    "CatchUseOfFreedInterfaces" is disabled.)
  Version 4.17 (15 July 2005):
 - Added the AddExpectedMemoryLeaks and RemoveExpectedMemoryLeaks procedures to
   register/unregister expected leaks, thus preventing the leak report from
   displaying if only expected leaks occurred. (Thanks to Diederik and Dennis
   Passmore for the suggestion.) (Note: these functions were renamed in later
   versions.)
 - Fixed the "LogMemoryLeakDetailToFile" not logging memory leak detail to file
   as it is supposed to. (Thanks to Leonel Togniolli.)
 Version 4.18 (18 July 2005):
 - Fixed some issues when range checking or complete boolean evaluation is
   switched on. (Thanks to Dario Tiraboschi and Mark Gebauer.)
 - Added the "OutputInstallUninstallDebugString" option to display a message when
   FastMM is installed or uninstalled. (Thanks to Hanspeter Widmer.)
 - Moved the options to a separate include file. (Thanks to Hanspeter Widmer.)
 - Moved message strings to a separate file for easy translation.
 Version 4.19 (19 July 2005):
 - Fixed Kylix support that was broken in 4.14.
 Version 4.20 (20 July 2005):
 - Fixed a false memory overwrite report at shutdown in "FullDebugMode". If you
   consistently got a "Block Header Has Been Corrupted" error message during
   shutdown at address $xxxx0070 then it was probably a false alarm. (Thanks to
   Theo Carr-Brion and Hanspeter Widmer.}
 Version 4.21 (27 July 2005):
 - Minor change to the block header flags to make it possible to immediately
   tell whether a medium block is being used as a small block pool or not.
   (Simplifies the leak checking and status reporting code.)
 - Expanded the functionality around the management of expected memory leaks.
 - Added the "ClearLogFileOnStartup" option. Deletes the log file during
   initialization. (Thanks to M. Skloff.)
 - Changed "OutputInstallUninstallDebugString" to use OutputDebugString instead
   of MessageBox. (Thanks to Hanspeter Widmer.)
 Version 4.22 (1 August 2005):
 - Added a FastAllocMem function that avoids an unnecessary FillChar call with
   large blocks.
 - Changed large block resizing behavior to be a bit more conservative. Large
   blocks will be downsized if the new size is less than half of the old size
   (the threshold was a quarter previously).
 Version 4.23 (6 August 2005):
 - Fixed BCB6 support (Thanks to Omar Zelaya).
 - Renamed "OutputInstallUninstallDebugString" to "UseOutputDebugString", and
   added debug string output on memory leak or error detection.
 Version 4.24 (11 August 2005):
 - Added the "NoMessageBoxes" option to suppress the display of message boxes,
   which is useful for services that should not be interrupted. (Thanks to Dan
   Miser).
 - Changed the stack trace code to return the line number of the caller and not
   the line number of the return address. (Thanks to Dan Miser).
 Version 4.25 (15 August 2005):
 - Fixed GetMemoryLeakType not detecting expected leaks registered by class
   when in "FullDebugMode". (Thanks to Arjen de Ruijter).
 Version 4.26 (18 August 2005):
 - Added a "UseRuntimePackages" option that allows FastMM to be used in a main
   application together with DLLs that all use runtime packages. (Thanks to
   Aleksander Oven.)
 Version 4.27 (24 August 2005):
 - Fixed a bug that sometimes caused the leak report to be shown even though all
   leaks were registered as expected leaks. (Thanks to Kristofer Skaug.)
 Version 4.29 (30 September 2005):
 - Added the "RequireDebuggerPresenceForLeakReporting" option to only display
   the leak report if the application is run inside the IDE. (Thanks to Guenter
   Schoch.)
 - Added the "ForceMMX" option, which when disabled will check the CPU for
   MMX compatibility before using MMX. (Thanks to Jan Schlueter.)
 - Added the module name to the title of error dialogs to more easily identify
   which application caused the error. (Thanks to Kristofer Skaug.)
 - Added an ASCII dump to the "FullDebugMode" memory dumps. (Thanks to Hallvard
   Vassbotn.)
 - Added the option "HideExpectedLeaksRegisteredByPointer" to suppress the
   display and logging of expected memory leaks that were registered by pointer.
   (Thanks to Dan Miser.) Leaks registered by size or class are often ambiguous,
   so these expected leaks are always logged to file (in FullDebugMode) and are
   never hidden from the leak display (only displayed if there is at least one
   unexpected leak).
 - Added a procedure "GetRegisteredMemoryLeaks" to return a list of all
   registered memory leaks. (Thanks to Dan Miser.)
 - Added the "RawStackTraces" option to perform "raw" stack traces, negating
   the need for stack frames. This will usually result in more complete stack
   traces in FullDebugMode error reports, but it is significantly slower.
   (Thanks to Hallvard Vassbotn, Dan Miser and the JCL team.)
 Version 4.31 (2 October 2005):
 - Fixed the crash bug when both "RawStackTraces" and "FullDebugMode" were
   enabled. (Thanks to Dan Miser and Mark Edington.)
 Version 4.33 (6 October 2005):
 - Added a header corruption check to all memory blocks that are identified as
   leaks in FullDebugMode. This allows better differentiation between memory
   pool corruption bugs and actual memory leaks.
 - Fixed the stack overflow bug when using "RawStackTraces".
 Version 4.35 (6 October 2005):
 - Fixed a compilation error when the "NoMessageBoxes" option is set. (Thanks
   to Paul Ishenin.)
 - Before performing a "raw" stack trace, FastMM now checks whether exception
   handling is in place. If exception handling is not in place FastMM falls
   back to stack frame tracing. (Exception handling is required to handle the
   possible A/Vs when reading invalid call addresses. Exception handling is
   usually always available except when SysUtils hasn't been initialized yet or
   after SysUtils has been finalized.)
 Version 4.37 (8 October 2005):
 - Fixed the missing call stack trace entry issue when dynamically loading DLLs.
   (Thanks to Paul Ishenin.)
 Version 4.39 (12 October 2005):
 - Restored the performance with "RawStackTraces" enabled back to the level it
   was in 4.35.
 - Fixed the stack overflow error when using "RawStackTraces" that I thought I
   had fixed in 4.31, but unfortunately didn't. (Thanks to Craig Peterson.)
 Version 4.40 (13 October 2005):
 - Improved "RawStackTraces" to have less incorrect extra entries. (Thanks to
   Craig Peterson.)
 - Added the Russian (by Paul Ishenin) and Afrikaans translations of
   FastMM4Messages.pas.
 Version 4.42 (13 October 2005):
 - Fixed the compilation error when "CatchUseOfFreedInterfaces" is enabled.
   (Thanks to Cristian Nicola.)
 Version 4.44 (25 October 2005):
 - Implemented a FastGetHeapStatus function in analogy with GetHeapStatus.
   (Suggested by Cristian Nicola.)
 - Shifted more of the stack trace code over to the support dll to allow third
   party vendors to make available their own stack tracing and stack trace
   logging facilities.
 - Mathias Rauen (madshi) improved the support for madExcept in the debug info
   support DLL. Thanks!
 - Added support for BCB5. (Thanks to Roddy Pratt.)
 - Added the Czech translation by Rene Mihula.
 - Added the "DetectMMOperationsAfterUninstall" option. This will catch
   attempts to use the MM after FastMM has been uninstalled, and is useful for
   debugging.
 Version 4.46 (26 October 2005):
 - Renamed FastMM_DebugInfo.dll to FastMM_FullDebugMode.dll and made the
   dependency on this library a static one. This solves a DLL unload order
   problem when using FullDebugMode together with the replacement
   borlndmm.dll. (Thanks to Bart van der Werf.)
 - Added the Polish translation by Artur Redzko.
 Version 4.48 (10 November 2005):
 - Fixed class detection for objects leaked in dynamically loaded DLLs that
   were relocated.
 - Fabio Dell'Aria implemented support for EurekaLog in the FullDebugMode
   support DLL. Thanks!
 - Added the Spanish translation by JRG ("The Delphi Guy").
 Version 4.49 (10 November 2005):
 - Implemented support for installing replacement AllocMem and leak
   registration mechanisms for Delphi/BCB versions that support it.
 - Added support for Delphi 4. (Thanks to Justus Janssen.)
 Version 4.50 (5 December 2005):
 - Renamed the ReportMemoryLeaks global variable to ReportMemoryLeaksOnShutdown
   to be more consistent with the Delphi 2006 memory manager.
 - Improved the handling of large blocks. Large blocks can now consist of
   several consecutive segments allocated through VirtualAlloc. This
   significantly improves speed when frequently resizing large blocks, since
   these blocks can now often be upsized in-place.
 Version 4.52 (7 December 2005):
 - Fixed the compilation error with Delphi 5. (Thanks to Vadim Lopushansky and
   Charles Vinal for reporting the error.)
 Version 4.54 (15 December 2005):
 - Added the Brazilian Portuguese translation by Johni Jeferson Capeletto.
 - Fixed the compilation error with BCB6. (Thanks to Kurt Fitzner.)
 Version 4.56 (20 December 2005):
 - Fixed the Kylix compilation problem. (Thanks to Michal Niklas.)
 Version 4.58 (1 February 2006):
 - Added the German translations by Thomas Speck and Uwe Queisser.
 - Added the Indonesian translation by Zaenal Mutaqin.
 - Added the Portuguese translation by Carlos Macao.
 Version 4.60 (21 February 2006):
 - Fixed a performance issue due to an unnecessary block move operation when
   allocating a block in the range 1261-1372 bytes and then reallocating it in
   the range 1373-1429 bytes twice. (Thanks to Michael Winter.)
 - Added the Belarussian translation by dzmitry[li].
 - Added the updated Spanish translation by Marcelo Montenegro.
 - Added a new option "EnableSharingWithDefaultMM". This option allows FastMM
   to be shared with the default MM of Delphi 2006. It is on by default, but
   MM sharing has to be enabled otherwise it has no effect (refer to the
   documentation for the "ShareMM" and "AttemptToUseSharedMM" options).
 Version 4.62 (22 February 2006):
 - Fixed a possible read access violation in the MoveX16LP routine when the
   UseCustomVariableSizeMoveRoutines option is enabled. (Thanks to Jud Cole for
   some great detective work in finding this bug.)
 - Improved the downsizing behaviour of medium blocks to better correlate with
   the reallocation behaviour of small blocks. This change reduces the number
   of transitions between small and medium block types when reallocating blocks
   in the 0.7K to 2.6K range. It cuts down on the number of memory move
   operations and improves performance.
 Version 4.64 (31 March 2006):
 - Added the following functions for use with FullDebugMode (and added the
   exports to the replacement BorlndMM.dll): SetMMLogFileName,
   GetCurrentAllocationGroup, PushAllocationGroup, PopAllocationGroup and
   LogAllocatedBlocksToFile. The purpose of these functions is to allow you to
   identify and log related memory leaks while your application is still
   running.
 - Fixed a bug in the memory manager sharing mechanism affecting Windows
   95/98/ME. (Thanks to Zdenek Vasku.)
 Version 4.66 (9 May 2006):
 - Added a hint comment in this file so that FastMM4Messages.pas will also be
   backed up by GExperts. (Thanks to RB Winston.)
 - Fixed a bug affecting large address space (> 2GB) support under
   FullDebugMode. (Thanks to Thomas Schulz.)
 Version 4.68 (3 July 2006):
 - Added the Italian translation by Luigi Sandon.
 - If FastMM is used inside a DLL it will now use the name of the DLL as base
   for the log file name. (Previously it always used the name of the main
   application executable file.)
 - Fixed a rare A/V when both the FullDebugMode and RawStackTraces options were
   enabled. (Thanks to Primoz Gabrijelcic.)
 - Added the "NeverSleepOnThreadContention" option. This option may improve
   performance if the ratio of the the number of active threads to the number
   of CPU cores is low (typically < 2). This option is only useful for 4+ CPU
   systems, it almost always hurts performance on single and dual CPU systems.
   (Thanks to Werner Bochtler and Markus Beth.)
 Version 4.70 (4 August 2006):
  - Added the Simplified Chinese translation by JiYuan Xie.
  - Added the updated Russian as well as the Ukrainian translation by Andrey
    Shtukaturov.
  - Fixed two bugs in the leak class detection code that would sometimes fail
    to detect the class of leaked objects and strings, and report them as
    'unknown'. (Thanks to Dimitry Timokhov)
  Version 4.72 (24 September 2006):
  - Fixed a bug that caused AllocMem to not clear blocks > 256K in
    FullDebugMode. (Thanks to Paulo Moreno.)
  Version 4.74 (9 November 2006):
  - Fixed a bug in the segmented large block functionality that could lead to
    an application freeze when upsizing blocks greater than 256K in a
    multithreaded application (one of those "what the heck was I thinking?"
    type bugs).
  Version 4.76 (12 January 2007):
  - Changed the RawStackTraces code in the FullDebugMode DLL
    to prevent it from modifying the Windows "GetLastError" error code.
    (Thanks to Primoz Gabrijelcic.)
  - Fixed a threading issue when the "CheckHeapForCorruption" option was
    enabled, but the "FullDebugMode" option was disabled. (Thanks to Primoz
    Gabrijelcic.)
  - Removed some unnecessary startup code when the MM sharing mechanism is
    disabled. (Thanks to Vladimir Bochkarev.)
  - In FullDebugMode leaked blocks would sometimes be reported as belonging to
    the class "TFreedObject" if they were allocated but never used. Such blocks
    will now be reported as "unknown". (Thanks to Francois Malan.)
  - In recent versions the replacement borlndmm.dll created a log file (when
    enabled) that used the "borlndmm" prefix instead of the application name.
    It is now fixed to use the application name, however if FastMM is used
    inside other DLLs the name of those DLLs will be used. (Thanks to Bart van
    der Werf.)
  - Added a "FastMMVersion" constant. (Suggested by Loris Luise.)
  - Fixed an issue with error message boxes not displaying under certain
    configurations. (Thanks to J.W. de Bokx.)
  - FastMM will now display only one error message at a time. If many errors
    occur in quick succession, only the first error will be shown (but all will
    be logged). This avoids a stack overflow with badly misbehaved programs.
    (Thanks to Bart van der Werf.)
  - Added a LoadDebugDLLDynamically option to be used in conjunction with
    FullDebugMode. In this mode FastMM_FullDebugMode.dll is loaded dynamically.
    If the DLL cannot be found, stack traces will not be available. (Thanks to
    Rene Mihula.)
  Version 4.78 (1 March 2007):
  - The MB_DEFAULT_DESKTOP_ONLY constant that is used when displaying messages
    boxes since 4.76 is not defined under Kylix, and the source would thus not
    compile. That constant is now defined. (Thanks to Werner Bochtler.)
  - Moved the medium block locking code that was duplicated in several places
    to a subroutine to reduce code size. (Thanks to Hallvard Vassbotn.)
  - Fixed a bug in the leak registration code that sometimes caused registered
    leaks to be reported erroneously. (Thanks to Primoz Gabrijelcic.)
  - Added the NoDebugInfo option (on by default) that suppresses the generation
    of debug info for the FastMM4.pas unit. This will prevent the integrated
    debugger from stepping into the memory manager. (Thanks to Primoz
    Gabrijelcic.)
  - Increased the default stack trace depth in FullDebugMode from 9 to 10 to
    ensure that the Align16Bytes setting works in FullDebugMode. (Thanks to
    Igor Lindunen.)
  - Updated the Czech translation. (Thanks to Rene Mihula.)
  Version 4.84 (7 July 2008):
  - Added the Romanian translation. (Thanks to Ionut Muntean.)
  - Optimized the GetMemoryMap procedure to improve speed.
  - Added the GetMemoryManagerUsageSummary function that returns a summary of
    the GetMemoryManagerState call. (Thanks to Hallvard Vassbotn.)
  - Added the French translation. (Thanks to Florent Ouchet.)
  - Added the "AlwaysAllocateTopDown" FullDebugMode option to help with
    catching bad pointer arithmetic code in an address space > 2GB. This option
    is enabled by default.
  - Added the "InstallOnlyIfRunningInIDE" option. Enable this option to
    only install FastMM as the memory manager when the application is run
    inside the Delphi IDE. This is useful when you want to deploy the same EXE
    that you use for testing, but only want the debugging features active on
    development machines. When this option is enabled and the application is
    not being run inside the IDE, then the default Delphi memory manager will
    be used (which, since Delphi 2006, is FastMM without FullDebugMode.) This
    option is off by default.
  - Added the "FullDebugModeInIDE" option. This is a convenient shorthand for
    enabling FullDebugMode, InstallOnlyIfRunningInIDE and
    LoadDebugDLLDynamically. This causes FastMM to be used in FullDebugMode
    when the application is being debugged on development machines, and the
    default memory manager when the same executable is deployed. This allows
    the debugging and deployment of an application without having to compile
    separate executables. This option is off by default.
  - Added a ScanMemoryPoolForCorruptions procedure that checks the entire
    memory pool for corruptions and raises an exception if one is found. It can
    be called at any time, but is only available in FullDebugMode. (Thanks to
    Marcus Moennig.)
  - Added a global variable "FullDebugModeScanMemoryPoolBeforeEveryOperation".
    When this variable is set to true and FullDebugMode is enabled, then the
    entire memory pool is checked for consistency before every GetMem, FreeMem
    and ReallocMem operation. An "Out of Memory" error is raised if a
    corruption is found (and this variable is set to false to prevent recursive
    errors). This obviously incurs a massive performance hit, so enable it only
    when hunting for elusive memory corruption bugs. (Thanks to Marcus Moennig.)
  - Fixed a bug in AllocMem that caused the FPU stack to be shifted by one
    position.
  - Changed the default for option "EnableMMX" to false, since using MMX may
    cause unexpected behaviour in code that passes parameters on the FPU stack
    (like some "compiler magic" routines, e.g. VarFromReal).
  - Removed the "EnableSharingWithDefaultMM" option. This is now the default
    behaviour and cannot be disabled. (FastMM will always try to share memory
    managers between itself and the default memory manager when memory manager
    sharing is enabled.)
  - Introduced a new memory manager sharing mechanism based on memory mapped
    files. This solves compatibility issues with console and service
    applications. This sharing mechanism currently runs in parallel with the
    old mechanism, but the old mechanism can be disabled by undefining
    "EnableBackwardCompatibleMMSharing" in FastMM4Options.inc.
  - Fixed the recursive call error when the EnableMemoryLeakReporting option
    is disabled and an attempt is made to register a memory leak under Delphi
    2006 or later. (Thanks to Thomas Schulz.)
  - Added a global variable "SuppressMessageBoxes" to enable or disable
    message boxes at runtime. (Thanks to Craig Peterson.)
  - Added the leak reporting code for C++ Builder, as well as various other
    C++ Builder bits written by JiYuan Xie. (Thank you!)
  - Added the new Usage Tracker written by Hanspeter Widmer. (Thank you!)
  Version 4.86 (31 July 2008):
  - Tweaked the string detection algorithm somewhat to be less strict, and
    allow non-class leaks to be more often categorized as strings.
  - Fixed a compilation error under Delphi 5.
  - Made LogAllocatedBlocksToFile and ScanMemoryPoolForCorruptions thread
    safe. (Thanks to Francois Piette.)
  Version 4.88 (13 August 2008):
  - Fixed compiler warnings in NoOpRegisterExpectedMemoryLeak and
    NoOpUnRegisterExpectedMemoryLeak. (Thanks to Michael Rabatscher.)
  - Added the Simplified Chinese translation of FastMM4Options.inc by
    QianYuan Wang. (Thank you!)
  - Included the updated C++ Builder files with support for BCB6 without
    update 4 applied. (Submitted by JiYuan Xie. Thanks!)
  - Fixed a compilation error under Delphi 5.
  - Made LogAllocatedBlocksToFile and ScanMemoryPoolForCorruptions thread
    safe - for real this time. (Thanks to Francois Piette.)
  Version 4.90 (9 September 2008):
  - Added logging of the thread ID when capturing and displaying stack
    traces. (Suggested by Allen Bauer and Mark Edington.)
  - Fixed a Delphi 5 compiler error under FullDebugMode. (Thanks to Maurizio
    Lotauro and Christian-W. Budde.)
  - Changed a default setting in FastMM4Options.inc: RawStackTraces is now
    off by default due to the high number of support requests I receive with
    regards to the false positives it may cause. I recommend compiling debug
    builds of applications with the "Stack Frames" option enabled.
  - Fixed a compilation error under Kylix. (Thanks to Werner Bochtler.)
  - Official support for Delphi 2009.
  Version 4.92 (25 November 2008):
  - Added the DisableLoggingOfMemoryDumps option under FullDebugMode. When
    this option is set, memory dumps will not be logged for memory leaks or
    errors. (Thanks to Patrick van Logchem.)
  - Exposed the class and string type detection code in the interface section
    for use in application code (if required). (Requested by Patrick van
    Logchem.)
  - Fixed a bug in SetMMLogFileName that could cause the log file name to be
    set incorrectly.
  - Added BCB4 support. (Thanks to Norbert Spiegel.)
  - Included the updated Czech translation by Rene Mihula.
  - When FastMM raises an error due to a freed block being modified, it now
    logs detail about which bytes in the block were modified.
  Version 4.94 (28 August 2009):
  - Added the DoNotInstallIfDLLMissing option that prevents FastMM from
    installing itself if the FastMM_FullDebugMode.dll library is not
    available. (Only applicable when FullDebugMode and LoadDebugDLLDynamically
    are both enabled.) This is useful when the same executable will be used for
    both debugging and deployment - when the debug support DLL is available
    FastMM will be installed in FullDebugMode, and otherwise the default memory
    manager will be used.
  - Added the FullDebugModeWhenDLLAvailable option that combines the
    FullDebugMode, LoadDebugDLLDynamically and DoNotInstallIfDLLMissing options.
  - Re-enabled RawStackTraces by default. The frame based stack traces (even
    when compiling with stack frames enabled) are generally too incomplete.
  - Improved the speed of large block operations under FullDebugMode: Since
    large blocks are never reused, there is no point in clearing them before
    and after use (so it does not do that anymore).
  - If an error occurs in FullDebugMode and FastMM is unable to append to the
    log file, it will attempt to write to a log file of the same name in the
    "My Documents" folder. This feature is helpful when the executable resides
    in a read-only location and the default log file, which is derived from the
    executable name, would thus not be writeable.
  - Added support for controlling the error log file location through an
    environment variable. If the 'FastMMLogFilePath' environment variable is
    set then any generated error logs will be written to the specified folder
    instead of the default location (which is the same folder as the
    application).
  - Improved the call instruction detection code in the FastMM_FullDebugMode
    library. (Thanks to the JCL team.)
  - Improved the string leak detection and reporting code. (Thanks to Uwe
    Schuster.)
  - New FullDebugMode feature: Whenever FreeMem or ReallocMem is called, FastMM
    will check that the block was actually allocated through the same FastMM
    instance. This is useful for tracking down memory manager sharing issues.
  - Compatible with Delphi 2010.
  Version 4.96 (31 August 2010):
  - Reduced the minimum block size to 4 bytes from the previous value of 12
    bytes (only applicable to 8 byte alignment). This reduces memory usage if
    the application allocates many blocks <= 4 bytes in size.
  - Added colour-coded change indication to the FastMM usage tracker, making
    it easier to spot changes in the memory usage grid. (Thanks to Murray
    McGowan.)
  - Added the SuppressFreeMemErrorsInsideException FullDebugMode option: If
    FastMM encounters a problem with a memory block inside the FullDebugMode
    FreeMem handler then an "invalid pointer operation" exception will usually
    be raised. If the FreeMem occurs while another exception is being handled
    (perhaps in the try.. finally code) then the original exception will be
    lost. With this option set FastMM will ignore errors inside FreeMem when an
    exception is being handled, thus allowing the original exception to
    propagate. This option is on by default. (Thanks to Michael Hieke.)
  - Fixed Windows 95 FullDebugMode support that was broken in 4.94. (Thanks to
    Richard Bradbrook.)
  - Fixed a bug affecting GetMemoryMap performance and accuracy of measurements
    above 2GB if a large address space is not enabled for the project. (Thanks
    to Michael Hieke.)
  - Added the FullDebugModeRegisterAllAllocsAsExpectedMemoryLeak boolean flag.
    When set, all allocations are automatically registered as expected memory
    leaks. Only available in FullDebugMode. (Thanks to Brian Cook.)
  - Compatible with Delphi XE.
  Version 4.97 (30 September 2010):
  - Fixed a crash bug (that crept in in 4.96) that may manifest itself when
    resizing a block to 4 bytes or less.
  - Added the UseSwitchToThread option. Set this option to call SwitchToThread
    instead of sitting in a "busy waiting" loop when a thread contention
    occurs. This is used in conjunction with the NeverSleepOnThreadContention
    option, and has no effect unless NeverSleepOnThreadContention is also
    defined. This option may improve performance with many CPU cores and/or
    threads of different priorities. Note that the SwitchToThread API call is
    only available on Windows 2000 and later. (Thanks to Zach Saw.)
  Version 4.98 (23 September 2011):
  - Added the FullDebugModeCallBacks define which adds support for memory
    manager event callbacks. This allows the application to be notified of
    memory allocations, frees and reallocations as they occur. (Thanks to
    Jeroen Pluimers.)
  - Added security options ClearMemoryBeforeReturningToOS and
    AlwaysClearFreedMemory to force the clearing of memory blocks after being
    freed. This could possibly provide some protection against information
    theft, but at a significant performance penalty. (Thanks to Andrey
    Sozonov.)
  - Shifted the code in the initialization section to a procedure
    RunInitializationCode. This allows the startup code to be called before
    InitUnits, which is required by some software protection tools.
  - Added support for Delphi XE2 (Windows 32-bit and Windows 64-bit platforms
    only).
  Version 4.99 (6 November 2011):
  - Fixed crashes in the 64-bit BASM codepath when more than 4GB of memory is
    allocated.
  - Fixed bad record alignment under 64-bit that affected performance.
  - Fixed compilation errors with some older compilers.
  Version 4.991 (3 September 2012)
  - Added the LogMemoryManagerStateToFile call. This call logs a summary of
    the memory manager state to file: The total allocated memory, overhead,
    efficiency, and a breakdown of allocated memory by class and string type.
    This call may be useful to catch objects that do not necessarily leak, but
    do linger longer than they should.
  - OS X support added by Sebastian Zierer
  - Compatible with Delphi XE3
  Version 4.992 (21 October 2016)
  - OS X full debug mode added by Sebastian Zierer
  - Included the average block size in the memory state log file. (Thanks to
    Hallvard Vassbotn)
  - Support added for Free Pascal's OS X and Linux targets, both i386 and
    x86-64. (Thanks to Zoe Peterson - some fixes by Arnaud Bouchez)
  - Added the LogLockContention option which may be used to track down areas
    in the application that lead to frequent lock contentions in the memory
    manager. (Primoz Gabrijelcic)
  - Support for release stacks added by Primoz Gabrijelcic. Define
    "UseReleaseStack" to use this new feature: If a block cannot be released
    immediately during a FreeMem call the block will added to a list of blocks
    that will be freed later, either in the background cleanup thread or during
    the next call to FreeMem.
  Version 4.993 (10 August 2021)
  - Added some "address space slack" under FullDebugMode. This reserves a
    block of address space on startup (currently 5MB) that is released just
    before the first time an EOutOfMemory exception is raised, allowing some
    GetMem calls following the initial EOutOfMemory to succeed. This allows
    the application to perform any error logging and other shutdown operations
    successfully that would have failed it the address space was actually
    completely exhausted. (Under FullDebugMode address space is never released
    back to the operating system so once the address space has been exhausted
    there is very little room to manoeuvre.)
  - Added the RestrictDebugDLLLoadPath option to only load the debug DLL from
    the host module directory.
  - Performance and other enhancements to the call stack generation. (Thanks to
    Andreas Hausladen.)
  - Added FastMM artwork. (Thanks to Jim McKeeth.)
  - Added the FastMM_GetInstallationState function:  Allows determination of
    whether FastMM is installed or not, and if not whether the default memory
    manager is in use or a different third party memory manager.

{The xmm6/ymm6 register is nonvolatile, according to
Microsoft's x64 calling convention, used for Win64,
denoted "The x64 Application Binary Interface (ABI)", or, briefly, "x64 ABI".
Since we cannot use xmm6, we use general-purpose
64-bit registers to copy remaining data.

According to Microsoft, "The x64 ABI considers registers RBX, RBP, RDI, RSI, RSP, R12, R13, R14, R15, and XMM6-XMM15 nonvolatile. They must be saved and restored by a function that uses them"

We are using that many ymm registers, not just two of them in a sequence,
because our routines allow overlapped moves (although it is not needed for
FastMM4 realloc) - see the comment at Move120AVX1 on why we are using that
many ymm registers.}

Although, under unix, we can use xmm6(ymm6) and xmm7 (ymm7), here we mimic the Win64 code, see the comment at Move216AVX1 on this.

We cannot use xmm6(ymm6) and xmm7 (ymm7) under Windows due to the calling convention.

According to Microsoft, "The registers RBX, RBP, RDI, RSI, RSP, R12, R13, R14, R15, and XMM6-15 are considered nonvolatile and must be saved and restored by a function that uses them."
