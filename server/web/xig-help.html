Here are some tips for effective searching:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Use Keywords: Enter relevant keywords or phrases that describe what you're looking for.</li>
<li>Quotation Marks: Use quotation marks to search for an exact phrase. For example, "project deadline."</li>
<li>Boolean Operators: You can use operators like AND, OR, and NOT to refine your search. For example, "sales AND report" will find documents containing both "sales" and "report."</li>
<li>Wildcard (*): Use an asterisk as a wildcard to match partial words. For example, "financ*" will find "financial," "finances," etc.</li>
</ul>
