<h3>FHIR Package Server - Upload API</h3>
<p>
This API allow FHIR users to upload their package directly to the Package server.
</p>
<p>
in order to use the package API, you need to get an API Bearer token from 
the <a href="mailto:fhir-director@hl7.org">FHIR product director</a>.
</p>
<p>
To create a package, POST the new package to [%path%] wth your token
as the bearer API. The mime type should be application/tar+tgz or 
equivalent (though it isn't checked).
</p>
<p>
The server checks that package, checks the permissions associated with 
the token, and that the package has not already been uploaded to the 
server, and then creates the package.
